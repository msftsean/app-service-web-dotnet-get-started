## Migration to ASP.NET Core

This repository is undergoing a migration from the classic ASP.NET MVC 5 (.NET Framework 4.8) sample to ASP.NET Core 8. A new scaffolded Core project (`CoreHost/CoreHostApp`) and initial unit tests have been added to enable incremental porting.

Resources:
- [Migration Guide](MIGRATION.md)
- [Release Notes](RELEASE_NOTES.md)

High-level next steps: port views & controllers into the Core project, add integration tests, then retire the legacy project once parity is confirmed.
